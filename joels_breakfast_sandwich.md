# Joel's Breakfast Sandwich

"I feel like adding avocado makes any sandwich a breakfast sandwich." - Joel

## Ingredients
- *2* Slices of Bread
- *1/2* Avocado
- *4oz.* of last weeks leftovers. Brisket is ideal, but anything will work.

## Directions
1. Cut the avocado.
2. It's a sandwich, dummy.
3. Really?

## Additional Notes

While preparing, make incredibly awkward statements for authentic Joel flavor.

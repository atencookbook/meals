# Sandra's Mom's Curry .. the taste of childhood you never had

## Ingredients
- Tupperware with curry and rice (premade!)
- bowl (optional)
- spoon 

## Directions
1. Make sure Sandra is on a client call.
2. Take the tupperware out of the fridge. Note: 
3. At this point you can either empty the contents into a bowl or be a real jerk and just microwave the tupperware. This does cut out an entire step.
4. Eat quickly.
5. Put tupperware back in fridge.

## Additional Notes

The steps for other people's food is similar, but there are important differences. I will elaborate on those in upcoming recipes.

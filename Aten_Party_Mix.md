# Aten Party Mix

This is a fun little dish we like to make every other Friday when the Mountain Man comes to visit us. Recipe as follows

- 1 bag Fuji Fire
- 1 bag Canyon Crunch (Definitely not Gardettos)
- 1 bag Seasonal Candy from the Season Prior

Mix everything together, leave out on the counter and forget about it until Monday. It doesn't matter, people will sill eat it.
